I'm a life-long learner. I like to learn new technologies, new languages and new ways of using old things.

I'm not afraid of making mistakes, which is probably one of the most important skills to have if you want to learn.

Thank you to every person who has posted useful code, documentation, and pointers for others to use. It is truly priceless.
